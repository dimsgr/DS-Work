The Problem: 
What's the background and scope of the project idea?
Use UCI Auto MPG data to predict mpg 

What problem are you attempting to address or solve?
Predict mpg . 

Data: 
What data exists to help solve this problem? 
city-cycle fuel consumption on miles per gallon, to be predicted out of 8 attributes

Where is it coming from? 
UCI
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

What does the data look like? 
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

What is the observation?
398 observations

Hypotheses: 
mpg will be high with high number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower and weight.
